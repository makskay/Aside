# Clash
Aside is a Bukkit plugin that aims to provide an improved chat experience for medium-to-large Minecraft servers. It adds a variety of features to chat, including:
* Quick, easy and intuitive multi-recipient private messaging
* Lightweight pseudo-channels for even easier private discussion, without the confusion or isolation of full channels
* Sound alerts for users mentioned in chat
* AFK auto-responder messages for people who attempt to talk to you while you're away
* Chat tags that provide additional chat post-processing, such as automatic URL shortening or in-line calculations
* A variety of chat administration tools, including the ability to silence everyone except specific players

Additionally, Clash provides an API which other plugins can use to check if a player should be protected, add PVP protection for safezone types not natively supported by Clash, and easily monitor who is in PVP with whom.
