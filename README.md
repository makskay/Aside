# Aside
*"Chat enhancements, done right"*

Aside is a plugin for Bukkit-based Minecraft servers. It adds a variety of features to the server chat.

## Never miss a message
Messages that mention your name or a group of which you’re a member will play a sound notification when they come in. If you’re AFK, messages that mention you will be saved for easy viewing when you return.

## Private messaging without the hassle
Messages that mention your name or a group of which you’re a member will play a sound notification when they come in. If you’re AFK, messages that mention you will be saved for easy viewing when you return.

## Quiet self-updating
I'll keep quietly improving Aside in the background, and updates will be pushed to you automatically. Just sit back and relax.

## Why Aside?
Most other chat enhancement plugins out there are clunky and unintuitive for the average user. Chat channels take forever to set up, and they divide your server community. Private messaging is single-recipient and relies on slash commands that are hard for newer users to get the hang of.

Aside is intuitive, Aside is self-demonstrating, Aside does it better... by doing it differently.
